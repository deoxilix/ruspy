This is a weekend project of mine, that i wrote to understand the basics of how an interpreter works!

```ruby

ruby controller.rb

```

###### Environment:

ruby:

    interpreter:  "ruby"

    platform:     "x86_64-linux"

    full_version: "ruby 2.2.3p173 (2015-08-18 revision 51636) [x86_64-linux]"
