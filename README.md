# Ruspy

Ruspy is a simple lisp interpreter, I wrote as a weekend project of mine, to understand the very basics of how an interpreter works!

##### Execution:

```ruby
ruby controller.rb
```

##### Environment:

    interpreter:  "ruby"
    platform:     "x86_64-linux"
    full_version: "ruby 2.2.3p173 (2015-08-18 revision 51636) [x86_64-linux]"
